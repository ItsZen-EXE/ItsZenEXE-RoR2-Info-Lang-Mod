# ItsZenEXE-Info-mod

You can download the files on the [Releases page!](https://github.com/ItsZen-EXE/ItsZenEXE-RoR2-Info-Lang-Mod/releases)

On Steam, open the game's properties then under "Local Files" press "Browse..."

Inside of the Risk of Rain 2 folder, drag/drop the "Risk of Rain 2_Data" folder from inside of this zip into the "Risk of Rain 2" folder you should be currently in. Press "Yes" if it asks if you want to replace any files.

The main menu should have a spot indicating that the mod is working now, as well as some info on it! :)

To disable the mod, you can simply delete the patch files in the en language folder!

This mod NO LONGER BREAKS every single update! so be patient when an update comes out for more info, or redownload the mod to reinstall it!
