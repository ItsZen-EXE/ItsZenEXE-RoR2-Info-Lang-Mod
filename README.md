# ItsZenEXE-Info-mod

On Steam, open the game's properties then under "Local Files" press "Browse..."

Inside of the Risk of Rain 2 folder, drag/drop the "Risk of Rain 2_Data" folder from inside of this zip into the "Risk of Rain 2" folder you should be currently in.

In game, under your profile in the top corner is a drop-down for languages. In there you can scroll down to find the "ItsZenEXE - Info Mod" language. :)

To disable, simply set it back to english.

This mod will break every update basically, so be patient when an update comes out for more info!
