# ItsZenEXE-Info-mod

On Steam, open the game's properties then under "Local Files" press "Browse..."

Inside of the Risk of Rain 2 folder, drag/drop the "Risk of Rain 2_Data" folder from inside of this zip into the "Risk of Rain 2" folder you should be currently in. Press "Yes" if it asks if you want to replace any files.

In game, under your profile in the top corner is a drop-down for languages. In there you can scroll down to find the "ItsZen_EXE's ItemStats Mod" language. :)

To disable the mod, simply set the language back to english.

This mod will break every update basically, so be patient when an update comes out for more info!
