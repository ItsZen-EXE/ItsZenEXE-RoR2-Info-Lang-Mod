From what I've heard about this planet, it could have been worse. We're surviving on plants our xenobiologist would have loved to study. Some sort of High Court signal is surveying this hell hole. Seems like a stretch, but I hope they look this way and are feeling generous.\r\nThrough trial and error, we discovered the most edible plant - they're disgusting raw, but after a sear they're tolerable, and their smell - a smell so sweet and powerful it saturates our filters. Reminds me of strawberries. Warmed in the sun.\r\nAt least we're alive.\r\n\r\nDay 03\r\nMy mouth tastes bitter unless I'm eating. Garret reports the same, his paranoia grows daily. He swears he sees the sap quiver and bounce every time we hack open these plants.\r\n\r\nDay 07\r\nTo be honest I'm starting to worry.\r\nMore exhausted each day.\r\nTerrible stomach aches at night.\r\nOf course we suspect the food but what other choice do we have?\r\nMy skin has an orange tint to it... maybe it's my vision.\r\nAll I smell lately is the sweetness of the sap.\r\nI pray I'm not getting sick.\r\nI'd hate for Garret to be right about something.\r\n\r\nDay 08\r\nWe're alive.\r\nI'm filled with hope.\r\nA High Court scout... or did she say seeker? Whatever she is, found our camp. A bit sharp around the edges but gave us some food. I savored every bite. She said it's not safe to travel at night and will lead us out of this mess in the morning.\r\nUnderground.\r\nWith real food to eat.\r\n\r\nKelvin out.",
