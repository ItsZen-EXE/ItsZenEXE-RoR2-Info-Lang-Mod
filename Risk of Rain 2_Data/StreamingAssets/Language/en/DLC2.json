Even through gloves, the coin burns colder than ever. I\u2019m terrified and compelled to place the coin on the pod, it snaps open.\nA dark gel oozes out, carrying a round device and tablet to my feet. The device activates and pulls the tablet with it into a hover. A construct? I know I should have shot it down, but I… feel it wants to help me get stronger.\nI touch the construct. Thousands of years push their way into my skull, the mounting pressure makes me howl in a voice I don\u2019t recognize, then nothing.\n---\nA pounding migraine wakes me. Midday. I feel moss under me and shield my eyes against the canopy light. I am closer to RallyPoint, but how? Disfigured beetles lay dead in a radius around me, faces distorted, limbs bent. I vomit. The construct hovers protectively nearby. How did it do this?\nDay 2\nStudying the tablet brings no comfort. I worry about Huang. The isolation grates on me, I\u2019m exhausted, hungry, angry. I finally found a supply chest but the construct absorbed my coin before I could use it. This lowly thing thinks it knows best. I don\u2019t know what came over me but I attacked the construct. It didn\u2019t seem to mind but that only made me feel worse. I am not myself.\nDay 3\nThe full moon\u2019s light makes me itch. It pursues me from it\u2019s dark sea, sluggish and unnerving. I stare into it, nearly falling into it\u2019s gaze. For hours I run terrified in the wrong direction. I cannot face it, not how I am. Under a deep canopy I draw familiar power from the construct. Inky feathers break through the skin of my arms and hands. I black out.\nDay 4\nThat blasted thing isn\u2019t cheap, the construct is obsessed with coin, but I can\u2019t argue with the results. The Lemurians barely put up a fight, obliterated, distracted by their song.\nThe last one drops from my talons.\nThey never should have been here in the first place. Where they are blind, I see the shapes of things and truly know them. I must reach…someone, somewhere. I cannot quite remember.\nIt is day\nRatssratsRATS gther n your shadow brother.
