# ItsZen_EXE's Logbook Extended Info

This is part of a larger modpack which you can find [here](https://thunderstore.io/package/ItsZenEXE/ItsZenEXEs_ROR2_Modpack/)!

This was meant to be a more "vanilla" text-only mod for myself initially, but decided to share it publicly due to popular demand! I know I enjoy not needing a wiki page open in the background anymore, and I hope you do too!

## Contents

In this portion of the modpack you'll find:

- Updated descriptions for every item.
  - Details have been added to each instance of item stacking, clarifying if it is Linear, Hyperbolic, or another type.
    - Some items with special stacking types (or important break points) have charts added to their logbook descriptions to showcase their unique properties.
  - Certain items have helpful charts and clarifications, attempting to make the items as easy to understand as possible, while remaining easily digestable.
- Equipment items have some notable changes, including now listing their base cooldowns, including in-game when looked at with the inventory menu.
  - (Almost) every equipment item now also has a listing for how many Fuel Cells are needed for 100% up-time (where applicable)
    - These also list an adjusted number for if you have Gesture of the Drowned.
- Certain typos or incorrect information in the base game has been corrected or clarified.

<b>It is worth noting that none of this would be in-line with other modded content. If you install other mods that change the base game's stats, this mod will not be correct anymore, nor will it apply to new content!</b>
