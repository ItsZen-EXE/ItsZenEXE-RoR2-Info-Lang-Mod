# ItsZen_EXE's Ping and UI Improvements

This is part of a larger modpack which you can find [here](https://thunderstore.io/package/ItsZenEXE/ItsZenEXEs_ROR2_Modpack/)!

This was meant to be a more "vanilla" text-only mod for myself initially, but decided to share it publicly due to popular demand! I know I enjoy not needing a wiki page open in the background anymore, and I hope you do too!

## Contents

In this portion of the modpack you'll find:

- <b>Updates to many aspects of the the ping system to provide more consistency.</b> The list below goes more into specifics:
  - <b>Updated the base ping to be more generalistic</b> (ie, "wants to move here!" is now "is pointing over there!")
  - <b>All pings start with the same green text as the default ping.</b> The color then changes to match the object/enemy pinged.
    - This helps provide consistency for all pings and prevent people glancing at the chat and seeing red text, assuming an ally died, which has been a complaint I have heard many times about the old system.
- <b>Many other aspsects of the text chat and UI as a whole have also been updated</b>, with a very detailed list below:
  - Lunar Coins now have consistency in their text, and always show the lunar coin icon next to their text.
  - <b>Almost every shrine has been updated to better convey at a glance the outcomes of the shrine's use.</b> Examples below:
    - Shrine of Blood now uses red text for the "Searing Pain" text, but the gold gained is the normal color.
    - The Shrine of Chance now uses red text when it is failed.
    - Mountain Shrines are considered World Events now.
    - Being sequenced now shows as red text.
  - <b>Many "World Event" texts have been updated to make them easier to notice at a glance, as well as to emphasize the impact they have on a run.</b> The following list all now count as "world events" and have their text changed in some way to signify this.
    - The Bazaar's Seers when used
    - Family Events
    - Monsters picking up items
    - Orbs appearing
    - Portals opening
    - Ancient Gates opening
    - Void Seeds Collapsing
    - Bosses spawning due to world events (Siren's Call Boss)
    - Mountain Shrines being activated and used
  - <b>All instance of teleporters in the UI now also have the teleporter icon next to it.</b>
    - The Primordial Teleporter's destination text has been changed to be easier to read at a glance.
  - Updated certain chest descriptons when inspected to showcase base item drop chances.
    - This does NOT include the item type specific chests, as that is something I wish to add in the future but is not done just yet.
  - The Eclipse menu has a MUCH, much more detailed look at the difficulties and their changes, with lots of notes for the different modes.
  - Some Final Bosses have death messages now for fun nods to lore, and to make their deaths feel more impactful.

<b>It is worth noting that none of this would be in-line with other modded content. If you install other mods that change the base game's stats, this mod will not be correct anymore, nor will it apply to new content!</b>
