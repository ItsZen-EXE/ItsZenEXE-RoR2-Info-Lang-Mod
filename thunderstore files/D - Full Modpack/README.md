# ItsZen_EXE's Modpack

This was originally meant to be a more "vanilla" text-only mod for myself initially, but decided to share it publicly due to popular demand! I know I enjoy not needing a wiki page open in the background anymore, and I hope you do too!

## Contents

In this modpack you'll find:

- <b>Extended/Corrected info on all items and characters, including proc info & more.</b>
- <b>Various helpful tips, charts, and clarifications.</b>
- <b>Heavy improvements to the ping system and various other adjustments to the text chat.</b>

For more detailed change lists, you can check out the individual mod's pages!
